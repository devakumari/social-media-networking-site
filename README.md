Project Title: Social media networking site  
Description: This is a dynamic and interactive social media networking site designed to connect people across the globe. With an intuitive user interface and a robust backend infrastructure, this project aims to provide a seamless social networking experience
This simple project is a Social Networking Site. This is a web-based application project developed in PHP and MySQL Database. This project is a version of my developed Social Networking Site. The site provides an online platform to virtually interact with other users by sharing posts and photos. The project user interface was developed with Bootstrap Framework and AdminLTE. It also consists of user-friendly features and functionalities.
I developed this project using the following:
XAMPP v3.3.0
PHP
MySQL Database
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Ajax
jQuery
Bootstrap
Font Awesome
AdminLTE
This Social Networking Site  is accessible to anyone. The users can simply register their system credentials by filling in the required fields and submitting the registration form. After the successful registration, the user will automatically log in to the site and will be redirected to the profile page where users can manage their personal information. In this project, the users can post content and images their posts will be only visible to them and their friends. Users can simply search for the user they know by searching them by name or email. Users can send a friend request to the others and also they can accept/confirm and decline friend requests. Each of the posts contains a like and comment feature. Like Comments are presented using a heart icon on each post. Comments and posts can be only deleted by the user who created them.
This Social Networking Site contains also an Admin Panel or Management Site where the site management can manage the list of posts, members, users, and system information. Here, the management can update the site, name, logo, background, and more. This site also requires a valid credential of the management user to gain access to the said features and functionalities of the system.
